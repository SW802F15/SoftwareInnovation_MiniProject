\section{Evaluation}
Key criteria for evaluations in your project plus one or more examples of evaluations  (see Essence-book Chapter 16).

Theoretical evaluation. Compare your work with some of the theories that are referred to in the course literature. The evaluation should not be value judgment-based, but should seek to relate your work to the theories and principles that the course draws from. You might like to focus on 
\begin{itemize}
\item Your process - the steps, tools and practices that you used to arrive at your results (SI Chapter 4,7)
\item Your eventual vision. Did you experience major changes or discontinuities in the vision during your work? (SI Chapter 1,3)
\item Your personal creative contribution (SI Chapter 5)
\item Team process and dynamics (SI Chapter 6) or some combination of these.
\end{itemize}
