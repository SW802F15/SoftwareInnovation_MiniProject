\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Paradigm Details}: Based on the findings from the 2nd release, a new scenario emerged: When the user is running with the screen off, it should still be possible to control the application.

\item \textbf{Product Overview}: The product design should include a way to interact with the application without a graphical interface.

\item \textbf{Project Details}: While the components are the same, a new feature is needed for the music player: A non-graphical user interface, allowing the user to navigate the application while running and without looking at the screen.

\item \textbf{Process Details}: Without any  feedback, e.g. a vibration, it is hard to determine if the command given in the non-graphical user interface was registered, making it harder to control properly. \newline
Additionally, it is necessary to take an appropriate action if the user stops running. This could be recording their last stable pace, and keep playing songs matching that tempo.
