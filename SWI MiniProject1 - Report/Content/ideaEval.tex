\section{Idea Evaluation}
%Key criteria for evaluations in your project plus one or more examples of evaluations  (see Essence-book Chapter 16).
%
To evaluate our ideas we have set up a number of key criteria that are important for the project. These are shown in \Cref{tab:criteria} along with how important we feel each criterion is. More criteria could be found, providing a wider view, but for simplicity we will focus on these.

%TABLE

Based on these criteria we can make a Value Analysis, as described by \citet[ pp. 118-120]{essence}, of our ideas. \Cref{tab:valueAnalysis} shows our Value Analysis of finding songs based on the user's pace.
