\section{VBM Review}
A VBM Review, short for Vision \& Business Model Review, should be done at the end of a sprint (or iteration), and is about evaluating the project in terms of four main dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What we see as the problem.
	\item What we see as the solution.
	\item Why we want to solve the problem.
	\item How we know we are doing it right.
\end{itemize}

These dimensions are closely related to the four Views: paradigm, product, project, and process \citep[pp. 44-47]{essence}.

Ideally each of the questions should be answered, but here we will focus on the Affordance Inquiry \citep[pp. 59-60]{essence}, which seeks to answer the second question.

\subsection*{Affordance Inquiry}
To keep the affordance inquiry simple, we will answer the generic questions stated in the book.

\textit{Is there any untapped potential in the design?}
%Music->run vs Run->music
%Step counter
%Music player
%Calories / running info
%Upload song info


\textit{Is all data available used in a relevant way?}
